# Warning: These scripts overwrite existing files.
Please ensure that you have backed up any important data in the files that will be generated by these scripts. Saving your files is not enough - if the script overwrites a file, any existing data in that file will be permanently lost!


# Entity Creation Script Usage

This document describes how to use the entity creation scripts. There are two scripts available: a shell script (`add_entity.sh`) and a Python script (`add_entity.py`). Both scripts are used to automatically generate boilerplate code for a new entity, dto, mapper, repository, service, and their corresponding test classes.

## Steps to use the Shell Script

1. Navigate to the `scripts` directory in your project.

```bash
cd scripts
```

2. Make sure the script is executable. If not, you can make it executable by running:

```bash
chmod +x add_entity.sh
```

3. Run the script with the name of the entity as an argument. Replace `EntityName` with the name of your entity.

```bash
./add_entity.sh EntityName
```

Remember to replace `EntityName` with the actual name of the entity you want to create (e.g., `UserAccount`).

## Steps to use the Python Script

1. Navigate to the `scripts` directory in your project.

```bash
cd scripts
```

2. Run the Python script. It will prompt you to enter the name of the entity.

```bash
python add_entity.py
```
