# Entity Creation Script Usage

This script is used to automatically generate boilerplate code for a new entity, repository, service, and their corresponding test classes.

**Warning: This script overwrites existing files.** 
Please ensure that you do not have any unsaved changes in the files that will be generated by this script.

## Steps to use the Script

1. Navigate to the `scripts` directory in your project.

```bash
cd scripts
```

2. Make sure the script is executable. If not, you can make it executable by running:

```bash
chmod +x add_entity.sh
```

3. Run the script with the name of the entity as an argument. Replace `EntityName` with the name of your entity.

```bash
./add_entity.sh EntityName
```

This will create the entity, repository, and service classes along with their test classes in the appropriate directories.

Remember to replace `EntityName` with the actual name of the entity you want to create (e.g., `UserAccount`).
